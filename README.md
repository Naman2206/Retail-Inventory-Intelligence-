## Project Overview
This project implements a foundational data engineering pipeline designed to efficiently process large datasets. It demonstrates how to break down voluminous raw data into smaller, manageable chunks, apply an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, and store the refined information in a curated, optimized format suitable for analytics, reporting, and machine learning applications.

The core idea is to transform raw, potentially unstructured or semi-structured data into a clean, consistent, and highly usable state, addressing common challenges associated with big data, such as volume, velocity, and variety.

---

## Features
- **Data Partitioning:** Demonstrates how to logically divide large datasets (e.g., by date) for efficient processing.
- **ETL Process:**
  - **Extract:** Reading raw data from simulated sources (CSV files in this example).
  - **Transform:** Data cleaning (handling missing values), enrichment (joining with lookup data), aggregation, and filtering.
  - **Load:** Storing transformed data in a structured, optimized format (Parquet files) in a partitioned directory structure.
- **Curated Data Layer:** Creation of a clean, consistent, and ready-to-use dataset for downstream consumption.
- **Scalability Foundation:** Designed with principles that can be extended to distributed computing frameworks (like Apache Spark) and cloud environments.
- **Modular Code:** Python scripts are organized for clarity and reusability.

## High-Level Architecture

The conceptual architecture for this data pipeline involves stages from raw data ingestion to a curated layer:


In this simplified example, `data/raw_data` acts as the "Staging Area" and `data/curated_data` represents the "Data Warehouse" or structured layer of a "Data Lake".

Copy
Edit
Do you also want me to fill in the ETL code for etl_pipeline.py, data_generator.py, utils.py, Airflow DAG, and sample SQL inside one big markdown block for GitHub? Or should I give you a ready-to-upload full GitHub repository (ZIP) with everything included?

# Data Engineering Project

## Installation

### 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas pyarrow
```

*Note: pyarrow is needed for Parquet file handling.*

## Usage

The `etl_pipeline.py` script simulates raw data generation, performs the ETL process, and stores the curated data.

### 1. Run the ETL pipeline:

```bash
python scripts/etl_pipeline.py
```

This script will:
- Create `data/raw_data` and `data/curated_data` directories
- Generate sample daily CSV files in `data/raw_data`
- Process these raw files, apply transformations, and save the curated data as Parquet files in `data/curated_data` with a `year=/month=/day=` partitioning scheme
- Print messages to the console indicating the progress and output locations

### 2. Verify the output:
- Inspect the generated files in the `data/curated_data` directory
- The script also includes a small verification step at the end to read a sample curated file

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud Integration:** Migrate data storage to cloud services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
- **Distributed Processing:** Implement ETL logic using Apache Spark (PySpark) for handling truly massive datasets
- **Orchestration:** Integrate with Apache Airflow or another workflow management tool to schedule and monitor the ETL jobs
- **Data Quality Checks:** Add more robust data validation and quality checks (e.g., using Great Expectations)
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Set up logging and alerting for pipeline failures or data anomalies
- **Streaming Data:** Adapt the pipeline to process real-time data streams (e.g., using Kafka/Kinesis and Spark Streaming/Flink)
- **Database Integration:** Load curated data into a data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) instead of local Parquet files
- **CI/CD:** Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or similar tools
